i gonna do  i keep telling myself keep doing like you are doing no matter how many lives you ruin it for the red  white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one ever indicted you why   cause you are a white boy  white boy you are a rockstar  my momma talk to me try to tell me how to live  white boy  white boy  in your cop car  but i do not listen to her  cause my head is like a sieve  white boy  white boy  you are untouchable  the world coming to an end  i do not even care  nobody can tell me shit  cause i am a  big rockstar  black boy  black boy  we do not get your culture and we do not care what our government done to   you over  man do not tell us your attitude a result of that balderdash  where would you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can  pull your pants up we bought to roll up  and throw your ass in the van  cuffed you do not have to know our plan or what our intentions are our guns are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease and you will get shot in the thyroid   cause you might die  boy we fighting a crime war here come the swine tryna  clean up these streets from all these minorities that why we call them pigstye for they are like eyesores to police talk to you like you are a piece of trash feels like we are stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts  and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it like we are drifting back into the 60s having black skin is risky   cause this keeps happening throughout history  african american have been treated like shit and i admit  there have been times where it been embarrassing to be a  cause you are a white boy  white boy you are a rockstar  my momma talk to me try to tell me how to live  white boy  white boy  in your cop car  but i do not listen to her  cause my head is like a sieve  white boy  white boy  you are untouchable  the world coming to an end  i do not even care  nobody can tell me shit cause i am a  big rockstar  pt  ii seems like  the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice that of a black life spanner wonder if sometimes it has a fight scanner i feel like checking out on life  can not escape my circumstance i would rather hear them say  die n word  than die antwoord ninja  now it better to describe banter but that life strapped   cause we are strapped financially and can not find answers we are applying for mcdonald it seems like the only franchise that will hire  so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes wack lives madder at cops and cops madder and that why it at a stalemate ca not arrive at a compromise so it black ops i wonder if we hire more  black cops  the crap stops the block is our backyard offices not the crook spot call the attack dogs off of us  man you always act pissed off at us a traffic stop and bad cops   it up for good cops and man  stop  sending white cops  into black neighborhoods  cause they ai not acclimated to  em like that the way to do it who seen some videos of rappers waving guns and no nobody black so they act afraid of us and that racism fear to the black face gives them a subconscious racist wait  why is there black neighborhoods   cause america segregated us designated us  to an area separated us section eight would us when we tear it up the only time attention paid to us and education sucks  every days another freddie grey for us  a levy breaks or fuzz why is it  they treat us like dryer lint  we just want a safe environment for our kids  but can not escape the sirens do not take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rate the highest in the lowest classes  its like a razor wire fence and we are trapped in  these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devil face lions  tigers and bears oh my  more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think we are guilty  cause we are black  but you kill each other  facts  you peel each others caps  for silly stuff like hats  single mother strugglin  through substance abuse while people with nothing to lose shoot each other for shoes   your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps  where the   is the boots  and streets act as a narrator do not gotta read comics or be that into characters  just to see that just to be black  you better be strapped  with a derringer  or be  capped in america  like steve rogers  cause no one overseas  these cops  and always see some b charges we see them beat rodney king and got off so we do not need all your crooked police peace offerings just keep marching  til  we reach congress but they gonna say you are tying to take an irrational stance cause you try to slander the flag but someone has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kapernick tantrum if you do not stand for the national anthem we raised it  you better praise it or you will be made to feel like a traitor  we will treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the bravest still  racist spills so the whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that it was foundation on based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you

this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case  cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on  i am back  from the mathers lp one when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put  em all in a line add an ak 47  a revolver and a nine see if i get away with it now that i ai not as big as i was  but i am morphin  into an immortal coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though and i do not know what the   that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with  ing cornrows you write normal    being normal and

summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming i am a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i am superhuman innovative and i am made of rubber  so that anything you say is ricochet in off a me and it will glue to you and i am devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a mother in  audience a feeling like it levitating never fading  and i know that haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off  they will be celebrating  cause i know the way to get  em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music  oh  he too mainstream   well  that what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  it not hip hop  it pop    cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock  shock rap with doc throw on  lose yourself  and make  em lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these verses that versus you it curtains  i am inadvertently hurtin  you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice  your songs you could sacrifice virgins to unghh  school flunky  pill junky but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself  but still hungry i bully myself  cause i make me do what i put my mind to when i am a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it still tongue and cheek    you i am drunk so satan take the  ing wheel i am asleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boys  still chunky  but funky  but in my head there something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but   it life handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i can not batter the women how the   am i supposed to bake them a cake then  do not mistake him for satan it a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard  be a king  think not why be a king when you

hungry looking at me like it lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on  i am back  from the mathers lp one when i tried to say i will take seven kids from columbine put  em all in a line add an ak 47  a revolver and a nine see if i get away with it now that i ai not as big as i was  but i am morphin  into an immortal coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though and i do not know what the   that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with  ing cornrows you write normal    being normal and i just bought a new ray gun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabulous made ray j mad  cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather pad singin  to a man while he play piano man  oh man  that was the 24 7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to radio station the very next day  hey  fab  i amma kill you  lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed   jj fad  uh  summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming i am a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i am superhuman innovative and i am made of rubber  so that anything you say is ricochet in off a me and it will glue to you and i am devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a mother in  audience a feeling like it levitating never fading  and i know that haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off  they will be celebrating  cause i know the way to get  em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music  oh  he too mainstream   well  that what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  it not hip hop  it pop    cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock  shock rap with doc throw on  lose yourself  and make  em lose it i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these verses that versus you it curtains  i am inadvertently hurtin  you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice  your songs you could sacrifice virgins to unghh  school flunky  pill junky but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself  but still hungry i bully myself  cause i make me do what i put my mind to when i am a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it still tongue and cheek    you i am drunk so satan take the  ing wheel i am asleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boys  still chunky  but funky  but in my head there something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but   it life handing you lemons make lemonade then but if i can not batter the women how the   am i supposed to bake them a cake then  do not mistake him for satan it a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard  be a king  think not why be a king when you can be a god ,eminem,hip-hop-rap

your fire back catch fire  get upset and fire back is what i tell myself when times get bad  cause sometimes i might get sad well i take the same advice i had and tell myself like i used to tell

the pen  i stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school  at his school  you ai not have to have no money or go shoppin  just to cop a  in  attitude now my dough amountin  to a mountain  it rised too high to count it never asked to be rich  all i did was wish i had a dime for every time that i was doubted but then i think about it and i am enraged  cause i just figured out that if i was paid for the time i spent to put the pen to the page it would be minimum wage but it embedded in my head and if i hunted for the bread and what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but i am never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood i put up in the pen and when i am dead i wonder will they put me on a pedestal or forget i was ever this incredible i guess i better go harder than ever  cause i will never get another motha in  opportunity again to offend as many people with this i can  simply because i can  cause nobody likes me  everybody hates me they

to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it lunchtime i know there was a time where once i  was king of the underground but i still rap like i am on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes  but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line i said on  i am back  from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say  i will take seven kids from columbine put  em all in a line  add an ak 47  a revolver and a nine  see if i get away with it now that i ai not as big as i was but i am morphin  into an immortal coming through the portal you are stuck in a time warp from 2004  though and i do not know what the   that you rhyme for you are pointless as rapunzel with  ing cornrows you write normal    being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya  like when fabolous made ray j mad cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather pad singing to a man while they played piano man  oh man  that was a 24 7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day   hey fab  i ama kill you   lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed  j j  fad  uh  summa lumma  dooma lumma  you assuming i am a human what i gotta do to get it through to you  i am superhuman innovative and i am made of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it will glue to you and i am devastating  more than ever demonstrating how to give a motha in  audience a feeling like it levitating never fading  and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off  they will be celebrating cause i know the way to get  em motivated i make elevating music  you make elevator music  oh  he too mainstream  well  that what they do when they get jealous  they confuse it  it not hip hop  it pop  cause i found a  hella way to fuse it with rock  shock rap with doc throw on  lose yourself  and make  em lose it  i do not know how to make songs like that i do not know what words to use  let me know when it occurs to you while i am ripping any one of these verses that versus you it curtains  i am inadvertently hurting you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too  ungh  school flunky  pill junkie but look at the accolades  these skills brung me full of myself  but still hungry i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i am a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it still tongue in cheek    you i am drunk so satan take the  ing wheel i am asleep in the front seat bumping heavy d and the boyz still  chunky but funky  but in my head there something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here what they want from me they are asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but   it life handing you lemons  make lemonade then but if i can not batter the women how the   am i supposed to bake them a cake then  do not mistake him for satan it a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip abroad and make her fall on her face and do not be a retard be a king  think not why be a king when you can be a god ,eminem,hip-hop-rap

the shifting whispering sands part 1, spoken by johnny cash  i discovered the valley of the shifting  whispering sands while prospecting in a western state i saw the silent windmills  the crumbling water tanks the bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards bleached by the desert sun i stumbled over a crumbling buck board nearly covered by the sand and stopping to rest i heard a tinkling  whispering sound and suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet the sand did not lie still i seemed to be surrounded be a mystery so heavy and apperceive i could scarcely breath for weeks i wondered aimlessly in the valley seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind where was everyone  why the white bones  the dry wells  the barren valley where people must have lived and died i sat down and buried my face in my hands and resting i learned the secret of the shifting  whispering sands how i managed to escape from the valley i do not know but now to pay my debt for being saved i must tell you what i learned out on the desert so many years ago  sung by the carter family  when the day is oddly quiet and the breeze seems not to blow one would think the sun is resting but you will find this is not so it is whispering softly whispering as it slowly moves along and for those who stop and listen it will sing this mournful song  sung by an unknown male choir  of sidewinders and the horn toads on the thorny  chaparral in the sunny days and moonlight lights the lonely coyotes yell  sung by johnny cash  how the stars seem they can touch you as you lay and gaze on high at the heavens where your hoping you will be going when you die,johnny-cash,country

man in black,well  you wonder why i always dress in black why you never see bright colors on my back and why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone well  there a reason for the things that i have on i wear the black for the poor and the beaten down livin  in the hopeless  hungry side of town i wear it for the prisoner who is long paid for his crime but is there because he a victim of the times i wear the black for those who have never read or listened to the words that jesus said about the road to happiness through love and charity why  you would think he talking straight to you and me well  we are doin  mighty fine  i do suppose in our streak of lightnin  cars and fancy clothes but just so we are reminded of the ones who are held back up front there ought to be a man in black i wear it for the sick and lonely old for the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold i wear the black in mournin  for the lives that could have been each week we lose a hundred fine young men and i wear it for the thousands who have died believin  that the lord was on their side i wear it for another hundred thousand who have died believin  that we all were on their side well  there things that never will be right i know and things need changin  everywhere you go but  til we start to make a move to make a few things right you will never see me wear a suit of white ah  i would love to wear a rainbow every day and tell the world that everything okay but i will try to carry off a little darkness on my back till things are brighter  i am the man in black,johnny-cash,country
the talking leaves,sequoia winters were sixteen silent tongue spirit clean he walked at his father side across the smoking battle ground where red and white men lay all around so many here had died the wind had scattered around snow white leaves upon the ground not leaves like leaves from trees sequoia said  what can this be what the strange thing here i see from where come leaves like these   sequoia turned to his father eyes and he said  father  you are wise from where come such snow white leaves    with such strange marks upon these squares not even the wise owl could put them there so strange these snow white leaves  his father shielding his concern resenting the knowledge sequoia yearned crumbled the snow white leaves he said   when i explain then it done these are talking leaves  my son the white men talking leaves  the white man takes a berry of black and red and an eagle feather from the eagle bed and he makes bird track marks and the marks on the leaves they say carry messages to his brother far away and his brother knows what in his heart they see these marks and they understand the truth in the heart of the far off man the enemies can not hear them said sequoia father   son they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves leave such things to them  then sequoia walking lightly followed his father quietly but so amazed was he if the white man talks on leaves why not the cherokee  vanished from his father face sequoia went from place to place but he could not forget year after year he worked on and on till finally he cut into stone the cherokee alphabet sequoia hair by now was white his eyes began to lose their light but he taught all who would believe that the indian thoughts could be written down just as the white men there on the ground and he left us these talking leaves,johnny-cash,country

the ballad of forty dollars,the man that preached the funeral said  it really was a simple way to die he laid down to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes  they hired me and fred and joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs it took us seven hours and i guess we must have drunk a case of beer i guess i ought to go and watch them put him down but i do not own a suit and anyway when they start talkin  about the fire in hell i get spooked so let just sit here in the truck and act like we do not know him when they pass anyway  when they are all through we got to go to work and mow the grass here they come and who that riding in that big old shiny limousine look at all that chrome i do believe that that the sharpest thing i have seen that must belong to his rich uncle someone said he owned a big old farm when they get parked let mosey down and look it over  that will not do no harm that must be the widow in the car and will not you take a look at that that sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black he not even in the ground and they tell me his truck is up for sale they say she took it pretty hard but you can not tell too much behind a veil listen ai not that pretty when a bugler plays a military taps i think when you were in the war they always hide and play a song like that well  here we are and there he goes and i guess that you might call it our bad luck i hope he rests in peace but the trouble is the fellow owes us forty bucks,johnny-cash,country

page_178,            here  the matter is not simply about how to describe an event by counting its              occurrences  it s about describing an event without counting all the times it occurs              in a reliable way  for example  if you want an algorithm to learn how to detect a              disease or criminal intent  you have to face the fact that you can t create a matrix              comprising all the occurrences of the disease or the crime  so the information that              you ll elaborate will be necessarily partial  moreover  if you measure something in              the real world  you often don t get the exact measurements because of some error              in the procedure  imprecision in the instrument you use  or simply because of a              random nuisance disturbing the process of recording the measure  a simple mea               sure such as your weight  for example  will differ every time you get on the scale               slightly oscillating around what you believe to be your true weight  if you were              take this measurement on a larger scale  such as by weighing all the people who              live in your city on one huge scale  you could get a picture of how difficult it is to              measure accurately  because error occurs  and completely  because it is difficult              to measure everything                having partial information  especially if what you want to describe is quite com               plex and variegated  isn t a completely negative condition  because you can use              smaller matrices  thereby implying fewer computations  sometimes you can t              even get a sample of what you want to describe and learn for certain problems               because the event is complex and has a great variety of features  as another exam               ple  consider learning how to determine sentiment from a text taken from inter               net  such as from twitter tweets  apart from retweets  you re unlikely to see an              identical tweet  expressing the same sentiment using precisely the same words for              precisely the same topic  by another person in a lifetime  you may happen to see              something somehow similar  but never identical  therefore  it s impossible to              know in advance all the possible tweets that associate certain words to sentiments               in short  you have to use a sample and derive general rules from a partial set               even given such practical restrictions and the impossibility of getting all the pos               sible data  you can still grasp what you want to describe and learn from it  sam               pling is a part of the statistical practice  when using samples  you choose your              examples according to certain criteria  when done carefully  you have a certain              probability that your partial view resembles the global view well               in statistics  population refers to all the events and objects you want to measure               and a sample is a part of it chosen by certain criteria  using random sampling               which is picking the events or objects to represent randomly  helps create a set of              examples for machine learning to learn as it would learn from all the possible              examples  the sample works because the value distributions in the sample are              similar to those in population  and that s enough       part   getting started with the math basics  ,machine_learning,data-science

page_185,from a mathematical perspective  you can express the representation process in  machine learning using the equivalent term mapping  mapping happens when you  discover the construction of a function by observing its outputs  a successful  mapping in machine learning is similar to a child internalizing the idea of an  object  she understands the abstract rules derived from the facts of the world in  an effective way so that when she sees a tree  for example  she immediately rec   ognizes it   such a representation  abstract rules derived from real world facts  is possible  because the learning algorithm has many internal parameters  constituted of vec   tors and matrices of values   which equate to the algorithm s memory for ideas  that are suitable for its mapping activity that connects features to response  classes  the dimensions and type of internal parameters delimit the kind of target  functions that an algorithm can learn  an optimization engine in the algorithm  changes parameters from their initial values during learning to represent the tar   get s hidden function   during optimization  the algorithm searches among the possible variants of its  parameter combinations in order to find the best one that allows the correct  mapping between the features and classes during training  this process evaluates  many potential candidate target functions from among those that the learning  algorithm can guess  the set of all the potential functions that the learning algo   rithm can figure out is called the hypothesis space  you can call the resulting clas   sifier with all its set parameters a hypothesis  a way in machine learning to say that  the algorithm has set parameters to replicate the target function and is now ready  to work out correct classifications  a fact demonstrated later    the hypothesis space must contain all the parameter variants of all the machine  learning algorithms that you want to try to map to an unknown function when  solving a classification problem  different algorithms can have different hypoth   esis spaces  what really matters is that the hypothesis space contains the target  function  or its approximation  which is a different but similar function    you can imagine this phase as the time when a child  in an effort to figure out her  own idea of a tree  experiments with many different creative ideas by assembling  her own knowledge and experiences  an analogy for the given features   natu   rally  the parents are involved in this phase  and they provide relevant environ   mental inputs  in machine learning  someone has to provide the right learning  algorithms  supply some nonlearnable parameters  called hyper parameters    choose a set of examples to learn from  and select the features that accompany the  examples  just as a child can t always learn to distinguish between right and  wrong if left alone in the world  so machine learning algorithms need human  beings to learn successfully                                     chapter    descending the right curve                 ,machine_learning,data-science

page_297,note the limitation of dealing only with numeric values  because you can t expect  the last layer to output a nonnumeric label prediction  when dealing with a regres   sion problem  the last layer is a single unit  likewise  when you re working with a  classification and you have output that must choose from a number n of classes   you should have n terminal units  each one representing a score linked to the  probability of the represented class  therefore  when classifying a multiclass  problem such as iris species  as in the iris dataset demonstration found in   chapter      the final layer has as many units as species  for instance  in the clas    sical iris classification example  created by the famous statistician fisher  you   have three classes  setosa  versicolor  and virginica  in a neural network   based on the iris dataset  you therefore have three units representing one of the   three iris species  for each example  the predicted class is the one that gets the   higher score at the end    in some neural networks  there are special final layers  called a softmax  which   can adjust the probability of each class based on the values received from a previ    ous layer    in classification  the final layer may represent both a partition of probabilities   thanks to softmax  a multiclass problem in which total probabilities sum to       percent  or an independent score prediction  because an example can have   more classes  which is a multilabel problem in which summed probabilities can be   more than     percent   when the classification problem is a binary classification    a single node suffices  also  in regression  you can have multiple output units    each one representing a different regression problem  for instance  in forecasting    you can have different predictions for the next day  week  month  and so on     going even deeper down the rabbit hole   neural networks have different layers  each one having its own weights  because   the neural network segregates computations by layers  knowing the reference   layer is important because it means accounting for certain units and connections    thus you can refer to every layer using a specific number and generically talk   about each layer using the letter l    each layer can have a different number of units  and the number of units located   between two layers dictates the number of connections  by multiplying the num    ber of units in the starting layer with the number in the following layer  you can   determine the total number of connections between the two  number of connections l     units l  units l      a matrix of weights  usually named with the uppercase greek letter theta       represents the connections  for ease of reading  the book uses the capital letter w   which is a fine choice because it is a matrix  thus  you can use w  to refer to the                       chapter    hitting complexity with neural networks               ,machine_learning,data-science

page_173,this is  for example  the probability of picking a certain suit when choosing a card  randomly from a deck of cards  french playing cards make a classic example of  explaining probabilities  the deck contains    cards equally divided into four  suits  clubs and spades  which are black  and diamonds and hearts  which are red   so if you want to determine the probability of picking an ace  you must consider  that there are four aces of different suits  the answer in terms of probability is  p              probabilities are between   and    no probability can exceed such boundaries  you  define probabilities empirically from observations  simply count the number of  times a specific event happens with respect to all the events that interest you  for  example  say that you want to calculate the probability of how many times fraud  happens when doing banking transactions or how many times people get a certain  disease in a particular country  after witnessing the event  you can estimate the  probability associated with it by counting the number of times the event occurs  and dividing by the total number of events   you can count the number of times the fraud or the disease happens using recorded  data  mostly taken from databases  and then divide that figure by the total num   ber of generic events or observations available  therefore  you divide the number  of frauds by the number of transactions in a year  or you count the number of  people who fell ill during the year with respect to the population of a certain area   the result is a number ranging from   to    which you can use as your baseline  probability for a certain event given certain circumstances   counting all the occurrences of an event is not always possible  so you need to  know about sampling  by sampling  which is an act based on certain probability  expectations  you can observe a small part of a larger set of events or objects  yet  be able to infer correct probabilities for an event  as well as exact measures such  as quantitative measurements or qualitative classes related to a set of objects   for instance  if you want to track the sales of cars in the united states for the last  month  you don t need to track every sale in the country  using a sample compris   ing the sales from a few car sellers around the country  you can determine quan   titative measures  such as the average price of a car sold  or qualitative measures   such as the car model sold most often   operating on probabilities  operations on probabilities are indeed a bit different from numeric operations   because they always have to be in the range of   to    you must rely on particular  rules in order for the operation to make sense  for example  summations between  probabilities are possible if the events are mutually exclusive  they can t happen  together   say that you want to know the probability of drawing a spade or a             chapter   demystifying the math behind machine learning                    ,machine_learning,data-science

page_193,more difficult to subsample because it needs a much larger sample  which may not  even fit into your core memory   beyond subsampling  a second possible solution to fitting data in memory is to  leverage network parallelism  which splits data into multiple computers that are  connected in a network  each computer handles part of the data for optimization   after each computer has done its own computations and all the parallel optimiza   tion jobs have been reduced into a single elaboration  a solution is achieved   to understand how this solution works  compare the process of building a car  piece by piece using a single worker to having many workers working separately  on car part aggregates   leaving a single worker to perform the final assembly   apart from having a faster assembly execution  you don t have to keep all the  parts in the factory at the same time  similarly  you don t have to keep all the data  parts in a single computer  but can take advantage of their being processed sepa   rately in different computers  thus overcoming core memory limitations   this approach is the basis of the map reduce technology and cluster computer  frameworks  apache hadoop and apache spark  which are focused on mapping a  problem onto multiple machines and finally reducing their output into the desired  solution  unfortunately  you can t easily split all machine learning algorithms into  separable processes  and this problem limits the usability of such an approach   more important  you encounter significant cost and time overhead in setup and  maintenance when you keep a network of computers ready for such data process   ing  thereby limiting the applicability of this approach to only large organizations   a third solution is to rely on out of core algorithms  which work by keeping data  on the storage device and feeding it in chunks into computer memory for process   ing  the feeding process is called streaming  because the chunks are smaller than  core memory  the algorithm can handle them properly and use them for updating  the machine learning algorithm optimization  after the update  the system dis   cards them in favor of new chunks  which the algorithm uses for learning  this  process goes on repetitively until there are no more chunks  chunks can be small   depending on core memory   and the process is called mini batch learning  or they  can even be constituted by just a single example  called online learning   the previously described gradient descent  as with other iterative algorithms  can  work fine with such an approach  however  reaching an optimization takes longer  because the gradient s path is more erratic and nonlinear with respect to a batch  approach  the algorithm can reach a solution using fewer computations with  respect to its in memory version                                    chapter    descending the right curve                ,machine_learning,data-science

page_211,provides a warning about leakage traps that can occur when some information  from the out of sample passes to in sample data  this issue can arise when you  prepare the data or after your machine learning model is ready and working   the remedy  which is called ensembling of predictors  works perfectly when your  training sample is not completely distorted and its distribution is different from  the out of sample  but not in an irremediable way  such as when all your classes  are present but not in the right proportion  as an example   in such cases  your  results are affected by a certain variance of the estimates that you can possibly  stabilize in one of several ways  by resampling  as in bootstrapping  by subsam   pling  taking a sample of the sample   or by using smaller samples  which  increases bias    to understand how ensembling works so effectively  visualize the image of a  bull s eye  if your sample is affecting the predictions  some predictions will be  exact and others will be wrong in a random way  if you change your sample  the  right predictions will keep on being right  but the wrong ones will start being  variations between different values  some values will be the exact prediction you  are looking for  others will just oscillate around the right one   by comparing the results  you can guess that what is recurring is the right answer   you can also take an average of the answers and guess that the right answer  should be in the middle of the values  with the bull s eye game  you can visualize  superimposing photos of different games  if the problem is variance  ultimately  you will guess that the target is in the most frequently hit area or at least at the  center of all the shots   in most cases  such an approach proves to be correct and improves your machine  learning predictions a lot  when your problem is bias and not variance  using  ensembling really doesn t cause harm unless you subsample too few samples  a  good rule of thumb for subsampling is to take a sample from    to    percent  compared to the original in sample data  if you want to make ensembling work   you should do the following         iterate a large number of times through your data and models  from just a        minimum of three iterations to ideally hundreds of times of them          every time you iterate  subsample  or else bootstrap  your in sample data         use machine learning for the model on the resampled data  and predict the        out of sample results  store those results away for later use         at the end of the iterations  for every out of sample case you want to predict         take all its predictions and average them if you are doing a regression  take the        most frequent class if you are doing a classification                                      chapter    validating machine learning                  ,machine_learning,data-science

page_175,for example  when you toss a coin  if the coin is fair  the a priori probability of a  head is    percent  no matter how many times you toss the coin  when faced with  a new toss the probability for heads is still    percent  however  there are other  situations in which  if you change the context  the a priori probability is not valid  anymore because something subtle happened and changed it  in this case  you can  express this belief as an a posteriori probability  which is the a priori probability  after something happened to modify the count   for instance  the a priori probability of a person s being female is roughly about     percent  however  the probability may differ drastically if you consider only  specific age ranges  because females tend to live longer  and after a certain age  there are more females than males  as another example related to gender  if you  examine the presence of women in certain faculties at a university  you notice that  fewer females are engaged in the scientific faculties than males  therefore  given  these two contexts  the a posteriori probability is different from the expected a  priori one  in terms of gender distribution  nature and culture can both create a  different a posteriori probability   you can view such cases as conditional probability  and express it as p y x   which  is read as the probability of event y happening given that x has happened  conditional  probabilities are a very powerful tool for machine learning  in fact  if the a priori  probability can change so much because of certain circumstances  knowing the  possible circumstances can boost your chances of correctly predicting an event by  observing examples   exactly what machine learning is intended to do  for  example  as previously mentioned  generally the expectation of a random per   son s being a male or a female is    percent  but what if you add the evidence that  the person s hair is long or short  you can estimate the probability of having long  hair as being    percent of the population  yet  if you observe only the female  population  the probability rises to    percent  if the percentage is so high in the  female population  contrary to the a priori probability  a machine learning algo   rithm can benefit from knowing whether the person s hair is long or short   in fact  the na ve bayes algorithm can really take advantage of boosting the chance  of making a correct prediction by knowing the circumstances surrounding the  prediction  as explained in chapter     which covers the first  simplest learners   everything starts with reverend bayes and his revolutionary theorem of probabil   ities  in fact  one of the machine learning tribes  see the  specifying the role of  statistics in machine learning  section of chapter    is named after him  also   there are great expectations for the development of advanced algorithms based on  bayesian probability  mit s technology review magazine mentioned bayesian  machine learning as an emerging technolgy that will change our world  http     www  technologyreview com news           emerging technologies that   will change your    yet  the foundations of the theorem aren t all that complicated   although they may be a bit counterintuitive if you normally consider just prior  probabilities without considering posterior ones                chapter   demystifying the math behind machine learning                    ,machine_learning,data-science
page_301,in linear regression  finding an update rule to apply to each parameter  the vector  of beta coefficients  is straightforward  however  in a neural network  things are  a bit more complicated  the architecture is variable and the parameter coefficients   the connections  relate to each other because the connections in a layer depend  on how the connections in the previous layers recombined the inputs  the solu   tion to this problem is the backpropagation algorithm  backpropagation is a smart  way to propagate the errors back into the network and make each connection  adjust its weights accordingly  if you initially feed forward propagated informa   tion to the network  it s time to go backward and give feedback on what went  wrong in the forward phase   discovering how backpropagation works isn t complicated  even though demon   strating how it works using formulas and mathematics requires derivatives and  the proving of some formulations  which is quite tricky and beyond the scope of  this book  to get a sense of how backpropagation operates  start from the end of  the network  just at the moment when an example has been processed and you  have a prediction as an output  at this point  you can compare it with the real  result and  by subtracting the two results  get an offset  which is the error  now  that you know the mismatch of the results at the output layer  you can progress  backward in order to distribute it along all the units in the network   the cost function of a neural network for classification is based on cross entropy   as seen in logistic regression          cost   y log h w x         y   log   h w x  this is a formulation involving logarithms  it refers to the prediction produced by  the neural network and expressed as hw x   which reads as the result of the net   work given connections w and x as input   to make things easier  when thinking  of the cost  it helps to simply think of the formulation as computing the offset  between the expected results and the neural network output   the first step in transmitting the error back into the network relies on backward  multiplication  because the values fed to the output layer are made of the contri   butions of all units  proportional to the weight of their connections  you can  redistribute the error according to each contribution  for instance  the vector of  errors of a layer n in the network  a vector indicated by the greek letter delta       is the result of the following formulation           n     n t    n                w  this formula says that  starting from the final delta  you can continue redistribut   ing delta going backward in the network and using the weights you used to push  forward the value to partition the error to the different units  in this way  you can  get the terminal error redistributed to each neural unit  and you can use it to                    chapter    hitting complexity with neural networks                  ,machine_learning,data-science

page_169,in matrix multiplication  because of matrix shapes  order matters  consequently   you cannot invert terms  as you would do in a multiplication of scalar numbers   multiplying     or     is the same thing  because of the commutative property of  scalar multiplication  but ab is not the same as ba because sometimes the multi   plication isn t possible  because the shapes of the matrices are incompatible  or   worse  it produces a different result  when you have a series of matrix multiplica   tions  such as abc  the order of the terms doesn t matter  whether you go with ab  first or bc first  you get the same result because  like scalars  matrix multiplica   tion is associative   glancing at advanced matrix operations  you may encounter two important matrix operations in some algorithm formula   tions  they are the transpose and inverse of a matrix  transposition occurs when a  matrix of shape n x m is transformed into a matrix m x n by exchanging the rows  with the columns  most tests indicate this operation using the superscript t  as in  at  you see this operation used most often for multiplication  in order to obtain  the right dimensions   you apply matrix inversion to matrices of shape m x m  which are square matrices  that have the same number of rows and columns  this operation is quite important  because it allows the immediate resolution of equations involving matrix multipli   cation  such as y bx  where you have to discover the values in the vector b  because  most scalar numbers  exceptions include zero  have a number whose multiplica   tion results in a value of    the idea is to find a matrix inverse whose multiplication  will result in a special matrix called the identity matrix  whose elements are zero   except the diagonal elements  the elements in positions where the index i is equal  to the index j   finding the inverse of a scalar is quite easy  the scalar number n has  an inverse of n   that is   n   it s a different story for a matrix  matrix inversion  involves quite a large number of computations  so special math functions perform  the calculations in r or python  the inverse of a matrix a is indicated as a     sometimes  finding the inverse of a matrix is impossible  when a matrix cannot  be inverted  it is referred to as a singular matrix or a degenerate matrix  singular  matrices aren t the norm  they re quite rare   using vectorization effectively  if performing matrix operations  such as matrix by vector multiplication  seems a  bit hard  consider that your computer does all the hard work  all you have to do is  determine in a theoretical formulation what happens to the numbers as you put  them into matrices  vectors  and constants  and then you sum  subtract  divide  or  multiply them               chapter   demystifying the math behind machine learning                     ,machine_learning,data-science
page_265,       when working with real data  you rarely have a ground truth to check  trust your         intuition and the cluster quality measures if you can t rely on a test  if you re not         satisfied with the solutions  look for ways to add and remove one or more of your         features   searching for classification by  k nearest neighbors         no matter if the problem is to guess a number or a class  the idea behind the         learning strategy of the k nearest neighbors  knn  algorithm is always the same          the algorithm finds the most similar observations to the one you have to predict         and from which you derive a good intuition of the possible answer by averaging         the neighboring values  or by picking the most frequent answer class among them          the learning strategy in a knn is more like memorization  it s just like remem          bering what the answer should be when the question has certain characteristics          based on circumstances or past examples  rather than really knowing the answer          because you understand the question by means of specific classification rules  in         a sense  knn is often defined as a lazy algorithm because no real learning is done         at the training time  just data recording          being a lazy algorithm implies that knn is quite fast at training but very slow at         predicting   most of the searching activities and calculations on the neighbors is         done at that time   it also implies that the algorithm is quite memory intensive         because you have to store your dataset in memory  which means that there s a         limit to possible applications when dealing with big data   ideally  knn can make         the difference when you re working on classification and you have many labels to         deal with  for instance  when a software agent posts a tag on a social network or         when proposing a selling recommendation   knn can easily deal with hundreds of         labels  whereas other learning algorithms have to specify a different model for         each label          usually  knn works out the neighbors of an observation after using a measure of         distance such as euclidean  the most common choice  or manhattan  works better         when you have many redundant features in your data   no absolute rules exist         concerning what distance measure is best to use  it really depends on the imple          mentation you have  you also have to test each distance as a distinct hypothesis         and verify by cross validation as to which measure works better with the problem         you re solving                                                  chapter    leveraging similarity              ,machine_learning,data-science

page_187,exploring cost functions          the driving force behind optimization in machine learning is the response from a          function internal to the algorithm  called the cost function  you may see other terms          used in some contexts  such as loss function  objective function  scoring function  or          error function  but the cost function is an evaluation function that measures how          well the machine learning algorithm maps the target function that it s striving          to guess  in addition  a cost function determines how well a machine learning          algorithm performs in a supervised prediction or an unsupervised optimization          problem           the evaluation function works by comparing the algorithm predictions against          the actual outcome recorded from the real world  comparing a prediction against          its real value using a cost function determines the algorithm s error level  because          it s a mathematical formulation  the cost function expresses the error level in a          numerical form  thereby keeping errors low  the cost function transmits what is          actually important and meaningful for your purposes to the learning algorithm           as a result  you must choose  or accurately define  the cost function based on an          understanding of the problem you want to solve or the level of achievement you          want to reach           as an example  when considering stock market forecasting  the cost function          expresses the importance of avoiding incorrect predictions  in this case  you want          to make money by avoiding big losses  in forecasting sales  the concern is differ           ent because you need to reduce the error in common and frequent situations  not          in the rare and exceptional ones  so you use a different cost function           when the problem is to predict who will likely become ill from a certain disease           you prize algorithms that can score a high probability of singling out people who          have the same characteristics and actually did become ill later  based on the sever           ity of the illness  you may also prefer that the algorithm wrongly chooses some          people who don t get ill after all rather than miss the people who actually do get ill           the cost function is what truly drives the success of a machine learning applica           tion  it s as critical to the learning process as representation  the capability to          approximate certain mathematical functions  and optimization  how the machine          learning algorithms set their internal parameters   most algorithms optimize          their own cost function  and you have little choice but to apply them as they are           some algorithms allow you to choose among a certain number of possible func           tions  providing more flexibility  when an algorithm uses a cost function directly          in the optimization process  the cost function is used internally  given that algo           rithms are set to work with certain cost functions  the optimization objective may          differ from your desired objective  in such a case  you measure the results using                                            chapter    descending the right curve                ,machine_learning,data-science
