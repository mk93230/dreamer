interlude jayzthe black album, and the other night when i was  researching  what we were going to be discussing today  i came across a passage that  i think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was talking about  and that all things must come to an end  it is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence  all things must conclude  take the analogy of a tree that grows in brooklyn  among the steel and concrete with all of its glorious branches and leaves  one day he too will pass on his legacy  through the seeds that drop to the ground  and as the wind carry these seeds throughout the land  a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand for a monument to the one that came before  ,jay-z,hip-hop-rap

page__69,managing and understanding data  although the mean is by far the most commonly cited statistic to measure the center  of a dataset  it is not always the most appropriate one  another commonly used  measure of central tendency is the median  which is the value that occurs halfway  through an ordered list of values  as with the mean  r provides a median   function   which we can apply to our salary data  as shown in the following example     median c                                   because the middle value is        the median income is                             if a dataset has an even number of values  there is no middle value                     in this case  the median is commonly calculated as the average of the                    two values at the center of the ordered list  for example  the median                    of the values          and   is       at the first glance  it seems like the median and mean are very similar measures   certainly  the mean value of         and the median value of         are not very  different  why have two measures of central tendency  the reason is due to the fact  that the mean and median are affected differently by the values falling at the far  ends of the range  in particular  the mean is highly sensitive to outliers  or values  that are atypically high or low in relation to the majority of data  because the mean is  sensitive to outliers  it is more likely to be shifted higher or lower by a small number  of extreme values   recall again the reported median values in the summary   output for the used  car dataset  although the mean and median price are fairly similar  differing by  approximately five percent   there is a much larger difference between the mean and  median for mileage  for mileage  the mean of        is approximately    percent  more than the median of         since the mean is more sensitive to extreme values  than the median  the fact that the mean is much higher than the median might  lead us to suspect that there are some used cars in the dataset with extremely high  mileage values  to investigate this further  we will need to add additional summary  statistics to our analysis                                                            ,machine_learning_r,data-science

page__359,evaluating model performance  estimating future performance  some r machine learning packages present confusion matrices and performance  measures during the model building process  the purpose of these statistics is to  provide insight about the model resubstitution error  which occurs when the  training data is incorrectly predicted in spite of the model being built directly from  this data  this information can be used as a rough diagnostic to identify obviously  poor performers   the resubstitution error is not a very useful marker of future performance  for  example  a model that used rote memorization to perfectly classify every training  instance with zero resubstitution error would be unable to generalize its predictions  to data it has never seen before  for this reason  the error rate on the training data  can be extremely optimistic about a model future performance   instead of relying on resubstitution error  a better practice is to evaluate a model  performance on data it has not yet seen  we used this approach in previous chapters  when we split the available data into a set for training and a set for testing  in some  cases  however  it is not always ideal to create training and test datasets  for instance   in a situation where you have only a small pool of data  you might not want to  reduce the sample any further   fortunately  there are other ways to estimate a model performance on unseen  data  the caret package we used to calculate performance measures also offers a  number of functions to estimate future performance  if you are following the r code  examples and have not already installed the caret package  please do so  you will  also need to load the package to the r session  using the library caret  command   the holdout method  the procedure of partitioning data into training and test datasets that we used in  previous chapters is known as the holdout method  as shown in the following  diagram  the training dataset is used to generate the model  which is then applied  to the test dataset to generate predictions for evaluation  typically  about one   third of the data is held out for testing  and two thirds is used for training  but this  proportion can vary depending on the amount of available data  to ensure that  the training and test data do not have systematic differences  their examples are  randomly divided into the two groups                                                        ,machine_learning_r,data-science

page__299,finding patterns   market basket analysis using association rules  one way to approach the problem of setting a minimum support threshold is to  think about the smallest number of transactions you would need before you would  consider a pattern interesting  for instance  you could argue that if an item is  purchased twice a day  about    times in a month of data   it may be an interesting  pattern  from there  it is possible to calculate the support level needed to find only  the rules matching at least that many transactions  since    out of       equals         we will try setting the support there first   setting the minimum confidence involves a delicate balance  on one hand  if  confidence is too low  we might be overwhelmed with a large number of unreliable  rules such as dozens of rules indicating the items commonly purchased with  batteries  how would we know where to target our advertising budget then  on  the other hand  if we set confidence too high  we will be limited to the rules that are  obvious or inevitable similar to the fact that smoke detectors are always purchased  in combination with batteries  in this case  moving the smoke detectors closer to the  batteries is unlikely to generate additional revenue  since the two items already were  almost always purchased together                      the appropriate minimum confidence level depends a great deal                     on the goals of your analysis  if you start with a conservative                     value  you can always reduce it to broaden the search if you are not                     finding actionable intelligence   we will start with a confidence threshold of       which means that in order to be  included in the results  the rule has to be correct at least    percent of the time  this  will eliminate the most unreliable rules  while allowing some room for us to modify  behavior with targeted promotions   we are now ready to generate some rules  in addition to the minimum support  and confidence parameters  it is helpful to set minlen     to eliminate rules that  contain fewer than two items  this prevents uninteresting rules from being created  simply because the item is purchased frequently  for instance       whole milk  this  rule meets the minimum support and confidence because whole milk is purchased  in over    percent of the transactions  but it is not a very actionable insight   the full command to find a set of association rules using the apriori algorithm is  as follows     groceryrules    apriori groceries  parameter   list support                                                  confidence         minlen                                                                 ,machine_learning_r,data-science
